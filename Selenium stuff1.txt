We cant get the selected textc024015
Hidden class-we cant extract using gettext -Disadvantages of selenium is it cant identify all the hidden elements/Ajax implemnetation elements
How to identify there are hidden elements-Investigate the properties of an object if it has any hidden text
with the help of java script we can extract the hidden elements-using javascript HTML DOM API(Document object model)
How can we shift the language from java to java script as we are working with java and selenium
the solution is to use javascript executor method in selenium java we can  able to write java script DOM steps as well
to execute first intialise the javascript executor as below

JavascriptExecutor js=(JavascriptExecutor)driver;// created js object same as driveer object
document.getElementById("Locator").value// to get the value of hidden text in the javascript// same as gettext in java but it cant find and get value but javascript can be able to get that value
double quotes inside double quotes use \(forward slash)
to get the output in java script need to use return as below
String script="return document.getElementById(\"Locator\").value"
js.executorscript(script)// to execute the java script script
String text = (String) js.executorscript(script); //(String)-Adding Cast to string
i=10;//Maximum autosuggestive list is 10
while(!text.equalIgnoreCase("AIRPORT"){
sendkeys.KEYDOWN
text = (String) js.executorscript(script);
if(i>10){
break;
}
}
if (i>10)
{sout("We havenot got Airport")}
else
{sout("We got Airport")}

///Handling SSL Cerification///Proceed anyway clicking or click advanced then click proceed

DesiredCapabilities c=DesiredCapabilities.chrome()         //Changing properties in chrome
ch.acceptInsecurecerts()  //allowing insecure cerficications
ch.setcapability(capabilitytype.Acceptinsecurecerts,true) //one more option to handle and have bunch of options to explore
ch.setcapability(capabilitytype.SSLcertify,true) //one more option to handle and have bunch of options to explore
We need to use the class chromeoptions in selenium --we can customise chrome browser options with this option 
ChromeOptions c= new ChromeOptions();
c.merge(ch);        //merging the properties to the local chrome browser
Syste.setproperty("webdrive.chrome.driver","Path");
Webdriver driver = new ChromeDriver(c);  // now this driver use the properties which have in object ch  as we merged in c we are using c here
driver.get(URL);

//Maximise the browser and delete the cookies in browser
driver.manage().window.maximise// for maximise the window
driver.manage().deleteallcookies  // to delete all the cookies
driver.manage().deletecookienamed("cookiename" // to delete one specific cookie with known cookie name
//If we delete the session id cookie your script should get logout(Scenario they want to delete session cookie and make sure secure login gets logouts and navites to home page)
So for this we are going to delete the specifi session cookie using 
driver.manage().deletecookienamed("cookiename of sessionid" 
then click on any link and verify your get title same as home


//Taking screenshots and kill the process in background
convert the webdriver object into screenshot object-change the object behaviour to screenshot object by CASTING DRIVER TO TAKESCREENSHOT METHOD OBJECT

File srceen = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotas(OutputType.FILE);  //to take screenshot
FileUtils.copyFile(srceen,new File("C://screenshot.png")); //copying file to local machine //we can download from apache commons io // aways check you have access to C to save else change that to D
